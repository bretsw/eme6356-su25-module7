# `r fa("fas fa-comments", fill = "#fff")` Ethics of Measurement

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/data.jpg")
```

--

- How accurate are the collected data?

--

- How good are the predictions of complex human behavior?

--

- How well does a measure represent real learning or performance?

---

# `r fa("fas fa-comments", fill = "#fff")` Ethics of Collection

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/surveillance.jpg")
```

--

- Do users have the right to opt in or opt out?

--

- What are the risks of the collected data becoming public?

--

- Who owns the collected data? Who owns where the data are stored?

---

# `r fa("fas fa-comments", fill = "#fff")` Ethics of Analysis

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/tools.jpg")
```

--

- What biases exist in algorithms?

--

- What factors are included or excluded in predictive modeling?

--

- Do users have the right to know and inspect what analyses have been conducted?

---

# `r fa("fas fa-comments", fill = "#fff")` Ethics of Reporting

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/amplify.jpg")
```

--

- How anonymous are users really? How easily can de-identification be done?

--

- How do truth and trust exist in relationship and in tension with each other?

---

# `r fa("fas fa-comments", fill = "#fff")` Recommended Solutions

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/relax.jpg")
```

--

- **Do no harm!** Operate in the best interests of users (e.g., students)

--

- **Transparency:** Be clear about the purposes for the data

--

- **Data literacy:** Educate users on data collection and privacy issues
